## Introduction

## Code usage
### [CMake Modules](./cmake_modules/Modules.md)
=======
# SysdarftRemake
Sysdarft is a hypothetical binary 64bit architecture. It aims to have a C/ASM compiler, debugger that hopefully can intergrate with CLion/VS Code, emulator (ncurses only), Operating System Kernel. It aims to be simple and easy.

Sysdarft is a hypothetical binary 64bit architecture.
It aims to have an ASM compiler, an invented high level language (higher than ASM, that is),
debugger, emulator (ncurses only, extendable if desired),
and an Operating System Kernel (Somewhat similar to DOS, since it has no protected mode).
It aims to be straightforward.
